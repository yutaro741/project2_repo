#This is answer of quiz 29. I did in two diffrent way so I will put it both.
```.py
def count_letters(dict, msg):
    for a in msg:
        for i in dict: #Roop for dictionaly and message and compare each things.
            if a == i:
                dict[i] += 1 #If there is equal things, add 1 to the letter in dictionaly.
    return dict #Return added dictionaly.

def count_letter(dict, msg):
    for a in msg:
        if a in dict.keys(): #This function will altomatically find the equal things that is in dictionaly.
            dict[a] += 1
    return dict #same prosess.


#From here is for output:
test1 = {"w":0, "l":0, "c":0}
test2 = {"a":0, "e":0, "i":0, "o":0, "u":0}
print(count_letters(test1, "hello world"), count_letter(test1, "hello world"))
print(count_letters(test2, "Why did I choose CS?"), count_letter(test2, "Why did I choose CS?"))
```

OUTPUT
```.py
{'w': 2, 'l': 6, 'c': 0} {'w': 2, 'l': 6, 'c': 0}
{'a': 0, 'e': 2, 'i': 2, 'o': 4, 'u': 0} {'a': 0, 'e': 2, 'i': 2, 'o': 4, 'u': 0}
```
